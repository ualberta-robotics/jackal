======

Common packages for Jackal, including messages and robot description. These are packages relevant
to all Jackal workspaces, whether simulation, desktop, or on the robot's own headless PC.

This is a fork of the clearpath repository, here we make changes to navigation parameters as well as provide configuration files for startup. See the `startup_config` directory README for information on those files and where they should be.

The tutorials folder is removed as it is unneccesary.
